## Combining CSS Selectors
You can combine different CSS selectors using certain operators, to apply your CSS rules more specifically and more generally.
### List of operators  
1. **Comma operator ',':** You can combine CSS selectors using a comma, which will apply your rules(attribute values) to all the css selectors. Example:
```css
h1, h2, p {color: green}
``` 
all h1,h2 and p tags will have the font color green.

2. **Child operator '\>':** You can modify all tags that satisfy the 'parent \> child' relationship. Example:
```css 
ul > li{color: blue}
```
will change the font color of all li elements that are children of the ul elements to blue. 

3. **Descendant operator ' '(denoted with a space between selectors):**, is the more general case of the child operator and specifies whether the lefthand selector is an ancestor of the righthand selector 'ancestor descendant'. Example:
```css
 .box li{color: yellow}
``` 
turns all li elements who have an ancestor with the .box class to the font color yellow. 

4. **Chaining selectors** works a bit different and does not use an explicit operator. Instead it places selectors adjacently with no spaces in between. If you are using an element selector it must be placed at the beginning of the chained selector. Chaining selectors are used to find very specific tags. Example:
```css 
p.class1{color: orange}
``` 
chains the paragraph element selector with a class selector, to change the font to orange for all tags that have their element as p and have a class of "class1".

5. You are also allowed to combine all the above! Example:
 ```css
  ul > p.obtained{font-size: 2rem}
``` 

[Class Example](./combining_css_selectors/index.html)

## CSS Positioning
* Static Positioning - Defaults to the next slot to put the item(can't be moved).
* Relative Positioning - Relative to default position.
* Absolute Positioning - Position relative to nearest positioned ancestor(parent) or top left corner of webpage
* Fixed Positioning - Position relative to top left corner of browser window(not webpage).

[Class Example](./css_positioning/index.html)

## CSS Display
* inline: Used to place items on the same line(box is as small as possible)(p{display:inline;})
* block: Uses the box-model to place boxes vertically on webpage(Usually default)(p{display:block;})
* inline-block: Allows boxes to be placed on same line(p{display:inline-block;})

[Class Example](./css_display/index.html)

## Float
Float is used to have text wrap around images as shown in [Example](./float/index.html)


## Media Queries
Media queries is our first example of website responsiveness. It allows us to to modify our website based on its window size.
* @media (max-width: 400px){...} is the syntax that works for modifying the css code of a window size between 0-400px.
* @media (min-width: 300px){...} is the syntax that works for modifying the css code of a window size between 300px-max window size.
* @media (min-width: 300px) and (max-width: 500px){...} is the syntax that works for modifying the css code of a window size between 300px-500px.
* @media (max-width: 300px) and (min-width: 500px){...} is the syntax that works for modifying the css code of a window size between from 0px-300px and 500px-max window size.

See [Example](./media_queries/index.html)


## Flexbox
Our second example for website responsiveness is flexbox.Flexbox provides a predefined layout for your webpage.  One way to think of flexbox is that it makes the boxes from the box-model flexible(we will see in example). Flexbox is easy to use, and is great for websites that have a 1-row or 1-column like structure. It is easy to resize boxes, and place them around the screen(especially to center!). Flexbox is less trivial when you have to structure your webpage like a grid(several rows and columns), and though possible the "display: Grid" functionality is a better alternative for these cases.
See [Example](./flexbox/index.html) <br>
You can also visit [flexbox cheatsheet](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) to get a reminder on how to use flexbox and relevent commands. 


## Grid
Grid is a display type that makes it easy to format your webpage in a table-like format. Here are the main arguments that you can modify in order to design your web-page(the arguments below accept units for fr, px, %, em and rem):
* grid-template-rows: used to set rows of grid(must be used in parent container)
* grid-template-columns: used to set columns of grid(must be used in parent container)
* grid-column: sets the range of the grid item with respect to its columns(must be used in child(grid item))
* grid-rows: sets the range of the grid item with respect to its rows(must be used in child(grid item))
* order: changes the order in which the grid items appear(must be used in child(grid item))

There are more arguments, but you can usually get away with using just these. 

See [Example](./grid/index.html)


## Notes
* Next class bootstrap
* Play with box-model on chrome
* Note that class="first second" is how you assign two classes to the same tag.
