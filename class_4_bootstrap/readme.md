## 2. Bootstrap
Is a CSS framework(most widely used), with predesigned libraries that you can include into your code.

### Pros: 
* easy and fast to use
* high browser compatibility 

### Cons:
* We add everything to classes and makes things look messy and not css like. 
* low customizations. 

### Installation:
* Add CDN link inside the heaer section and CDN script at the end of the body section. Find links at [getbootstrap.com](https://getbootstrap.com) 


### How to use:
There are two mains ways to use bootstrap:  
* Using the 12 column flexbox design, that uses flexbox(in the background) to create grid-like websites [example2](./example2/index.html). [Documentation 1](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/layout/columns/) for showing the different sizes, media function, and spacing. 
* Using the open source code from [Documentation 2](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/examples/) as templates to create your own websites. Here is an [example](./example4/index.html), this is a fast and easy way to build a website!


## 3. Notes
* Homework: Install node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/), create a company and use bootstrap to create a website for that company. Be creative!
